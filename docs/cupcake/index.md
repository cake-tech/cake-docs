# :icons-cupcake-light: Cupcake

Cupcake is the latest app in the Cake Wallet family, focused on making crypto security possible for everyone. No more waiting weeks for shipping and customs, no more $200+ costs, no more terrifying data breaches. If you have an old phone lying around, Cupcake lets you turn it into a powerful hardware wallet with just a few taps.

It works similarly to an air-gapped hardware wallet, separating the private keys from the main wallet app and becoming a dedicated signer.

Cupcake contains the private keys for transaction signing, while Cake Wallet has only the view keys (or public keys) necessary to see your balance, historical transactions, and generate new transactions for Cupcake to sign.

## Download

Cupcake can be downloaded from the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/eg/app/cupcake-by-cake-wallet/id6737430272){:target="_blank"}, [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cakewallet.cupcake), [Accrescent](https://accrescent.app) and the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/cake-tech/cupcake/releases).

Cupcake is currently only supported on iOS and Android.

## Supported cryptocurrencies

Cupcake currently supports Bitcoin and Monero, but more cryptocurrencies will be supported in the future, starting with Litecoin (including MWEB support).
