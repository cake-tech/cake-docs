## Linking to Cake Wallet

As Cupcake has no access to the internet, to properly see your transaction history, balances, and to create and send new transactions you'll need to pair it with Cake Wallet.

1. To link with Cake Wallet, open the `Menu` and select `Link to Cake Wallet`. You'll use this QR in the next steps.
