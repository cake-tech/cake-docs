## Receiving Bitcoin or Litecoin

To receive BTC to your Bitcoin wallet within the Cake Wallet app, you will need to provide your wallet's address or QR code to the sender. A wallet's address can be found by clicking `Receive` on the home screen. Here, you can copy the address by tapping the copy icon, or you can click to expand the QR code to receive funds. We automatically generate new Bitcoin addresses for better privacy after they are used. We encourage you to use a new Bitcoin address each time, but previous addresses continue to work.
