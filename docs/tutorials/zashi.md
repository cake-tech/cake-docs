## *Recommended method:* Sending to a new wallet in Cake

The easiest path is to simply create a new Zcash wallet in Cake Wallet and transfer your funds over with a simple transaction. Not only does this allow you to skip the lengthy synchronization process of restoring an older Zcash wallet, but it also lets you get all of the benefits of using [one seed for all of your crypto hot wallets](https://blog.cakewallet.com/cake-wallet-introduces-monero-wallet-groups-new-seed-formats-and-more/).

With a new, 12-word seed, you get a fresh start, faster restoration, and the ability to leverage one backup for all of your favorite cryptocurrency wallets in Cake.

### Creating a new Zcash wallet on Cake

1. Download Cake Wallet [using the links above](#installing-cake-wallet)
2. Open Cake Wallet
3. Tap `Set a PIN` and set a PIN for the app
    1. Note: If you want to use a longer 6-digit PIN, simply tap `Switch to 6-digit PIN`

    !!! note
        If you already have an existing wallet or wallet group in Cake Wallet, you can choose that group here to use an existing 12-word seed.

    ![Create your wallet's name](zashi/create_name.png){: style="height:750px"}
    
7. Follow the on-screen warnings about your seed phrase, then tap `Verify`

    a. Store your seed phrase in a safe place where you can import it into Cake Wallet in the next section. We recommend a few options:
    - Storing your seed in an **end-to-end encrypted** password manager like [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/), [Proton Pass](https://proton.me/pass), or iCloud Keychain
    - Writing it down and keeping it in a **secure place**
    
!!! warning
    Do not share these seed words with anyone or store them via screenshots or in an insecure note app, as anyone with access to your seed words has the ability to steal all of your Zcash!
    
1. Verify your backup by tapping the correct seed words in the order prompted
2. Tap `Receive` on the bottom dock to display a QR code with a Zcash receive address
    1. Note: If necessary, you can easily copy or share the address by tapping the icon next to the address, then sending to yourself via a messaging app, email, etc.
