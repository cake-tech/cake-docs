## Installing Cake Wallet

Cake Wallet is available on Android, iOS, macOS, Linux, and Windows.

For the best compatibility and easiest setup we recommend using the mobile version of Cake Wallet to get started, and then explore our desktop apps down the line.

Please choose one of the options below to get started:

[:simple-android: Android](/get-started/android/){ .md-button }
[:simple-apple: iOS / macOS](/get-started/app-store){ .md-button }
[:simple-linux: Linux](/get-started/linux/){ .md-button }
[:material-microsoft-windows: Windows](/get-started/windows){ .md-button }

## *Recommended method:* Sending to a new wallet in Cake

The easiest path is to simply create a new Monero wallet in Cake Wallet and transfer your funds over with a simple transaction. Not only does this allow you to skip the lengthy synchronization process of restoring an older Monero wallet, but it also lets you get all of the benefits of a new seed format in Monero called ‚ÄúPolyseed.‚Äù

This newer seed format is easier to backup and restore (only 16 words, instead of 25), encodes the restore height directly into the seed phrase, and has several other security features that ensure your Monero stays safer than ever.

### Creating a new Monero wallet on Cake

2. Open Cake Wallet
3. Tap `Set a PIN` and set a PIN for the app
    1. Note: If you want to use a longer 6-digit PIN, simply tap `Switch to 6-digit PIN`

    - Writing it down and keeping it in a **secure place**

## *Advanced method:* Exporting an existing wallet to Cake

For those who want to preserve their transaction history or have a specific reason to keep using their existing Exodus seed phrase, you can easily export it and restore in Cake Wallet. Note that this 25-word seed phrase differs from the general 12-word seed phrase that Exodus uses for other cryptocurrencies, and must be backed up separately before you can restore your Monero wallet in Cake Wallet.
