## Installing Cake Wallet

Cake Wallet is available on Android, iOS, macOS, Linux, and Windows.

For the best compatibility and easiest setup we recommend using the mobile version of Cake Wallet to get started, and then explore our desktop apps down the line.

Please choose one of the options below to get started:

[:simple-android: Android](/get-started/android/){ .md-button }
[:simple-apple: iOS / macOS](/get-started/app-store){ .md-button }
[:simple-linux: Linux](/get-started/linux/){ .md-button }
[:material-microsoft-windows: Windows](/get-started/windows){ .md-button }

## *Recommended method:* Sending to a new wallet in Cake

The easiest path is to simply create a new Monero wallet in Cake Wallet and transfer your funds over with a simple transaction. Not only does this allow you to skip the lengthy synchronization process of restoring an older Monero wallet, but it also lets you get all of the benefits of a new seed format in Monero called ‚ÄúPolyseed.‚Äù

This newer seed format is easier to backup and restore (only 16 words, instead of 25), encodes the restore height directly into the seed phrase, and has several other security features that ensure your Monero stays safer than ever.

!!! note ""
    Alternatively, you can create a new Monero wallet using a 12-word BIP 39 seed, which enables you to use one seed for all of your crypto wallets in Cake. In the future this will be the default seed format for Monero wallets in Cake due to the simplicity it brings to seed backups.

### Creating a new Monero wallet on Cake

1. Download Cake Wallet [using the links above](#installing-cake-wallet)
2. Open Cake Wallet
3. Tap `Set a PIN` and set a PIN for the app
    1. Note: If you want to use a longer 6-digit PIN, simply tap `Switch to 6-digit PIN`
        
        ![Create a PIN](mymonero/pin.png){: style="height:750px"}
        
4. Tap `Create New Wallet`
    
    ![Choose Create Wallet](mymonero/create.png){: style="height:750px"}
    
5. Select `Monero` as the wallet currency and then tap `Next`
    
    ![Select Monero as the currency](mymonero/monero.png){: style="height:750px"}
    
6. Enter a wallet name (or tap the üîÑ¬†button to create a random name) and then tap `Next`
    
    ![Create your wallet's name](mymonero/create_name.png){: style="height:750px"}
    
7. Follow the on-screen warnings about your seed phrase, then tap `Verify`

    a. Store your seed phrase in a safe place where you can import it into Cake Wallet in the next section. We recommend a few options:
    - Storing your seed in an **end-to-end encrypted** password manager like [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/), [Proton Pass](https://proton.me/pass), or iCloud Keychain
    - Writing it down and keeping it in a **secure place**
    
!!! warning
    Do not share these seed words with anyone or store them via screenshots or in an insecure note app, as anyone with access to your seed words has the ability to steal all of your Monero!
    
1. Verify your backup by tapping the correct seed words in the order prompted
2. Tap `Receive` on the bottom dock to display a QR code with a Monero receive address
    1. Note: If necessary, you can easily copy or share the address by tapping the icon next to the address, then sending to yourself via a messaging app, email, etc. 

![Tap Receive](mymonero/home_receive.png){: style="height:750px"}

![Copy your address](mymonero/receive.png){: style="height:750px"}

### Send Monero balance from MyMonero Mobile

1. On the home page of MyMonero, select the wallet you want to migrate over to Cake
    
    ![Choose your wallet in MyMonero](mymonero/mm_choose_wallet.png){: style="height:750px"}
    
2. Tap the Send button at the top right
    
    ![Tap Send](mymonero/mm_home_send.jpeg){: style="height:750px"}

5. Enter your wallet password, and tap `Next` to send the transaction
6. Once you have sent the funds, confirm they show up in your new Monero wallet in Cake

## *Advanced method:* Exporting an existing wallet to Cake

For those who want to preserve their transaction history or have a specific reason to keep using their existing MyMonero seed phrase, you can easily export it and restore in Cake Wallet.

!!! note
    When using this method, you'll notice the main difference between MyMonero and Cake Wallet. MyMonero relies on sending a view key to a remote server, something that reduces your privacy but forgoes the need to sync your wallet at all. Cake Wallet takes a different approach, where you do all wallet sync on-device for maximum privacy. This sync process can take some time when restoring older wallets, but can be drastically improved by performing initial sync on a good network or enabling [background sync on Android](/features/advanced/background-sync/).

### Backing up your Monero from MyMonero

1. On the home page of MyMonero, select the wallet you want to migrate over to Cake

    ![Choose your wallet in MyMonero](mymonero/mm_choose_wallet.png){: style="height:750px"}

2. Expand the toggle/drop-down by Address

    ![Expand the secrets dropdown](mymonero/mm_home_dropdown.jpeg){: style="height:750px"}

3. Confirm that you‚Äôre in a safe place and are OK to display your private keys on-screen

!!! warning
    Do not share these seed words with anyone or store them via screenshots or in an insecure note app, as anyone with access to your seed words has the ability to steal all of your Monero!

5. Either tap the copy button, or write down your 25-word seed phrase (in the box labeled `Secret Mnemonic`) in a safe place where you can import it into Cake Wallet in the next section. We recommend a few options:
    - Storing your seed in an **end-to-end encrypted** password manage like Bitwarden, Proton Pass, or iCloud Keychain
    - Writing it down and keeping it in a **secure place**

    ![Copy your Secret Mnemonic](mymonero/mm_copy_seed.jpg){: style="height:750px"}

### Restoring your wallet in Cake Wallet

1. Tap `Set a PIN` and set a PIN for the app
    
    ![Create a PIN](mymonero/pin.png){: style="height:750px"}
    
2. Tap `Restore Existing Wallet`
    
    ![Choose Restore Wallet](mymonero/restore.png){: style="height:750px"}

7. Tap the `Polyseed (16 words)` option and change to `Legacy (25 words)`

    ![Change to Legacy seed type](mymonero/restore_legacy.png){: style="height:750px"}
    
8. Tap `Restore`
9.  Once restored, you will see a synchronization status bar at the top of the balance screen as Cake Wallet checks the Monero blockchain for your wallet history and balance
