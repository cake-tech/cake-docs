??? question "Why do I need to activate certain products on a different website?"

    Some products require you to activate the item on another website to prevent fraud and ensure delivery of cards.

??? question "What fees are there?"

    Cake Pay products are sold at face value, with a very small fee added to cover cryptocurrency conversion costs for Cake Pay.

??? question "Are there any limits?"

    Yes, there are limits. A single user can purchase a maximum of $5,000 per day. You may run into other limits, and limits are subject to change.

??? question "Why is Cake Wallet showing a slightly different fiat value than the Cake Pay invoice amount?"

    Cake Wallet uses a different fiat API endpoint than the Cake Pay endpoint. This can lead to small (<1%) differences in prices shown. For non-USD denominated products, the spread may be a little larger because we buy the cards in USD, and there is thus an implied spread that Cake must pay between USD and the other fiat asset. Always make sure to send the exact amount of cryptocurrency specified for the invoice. Cake Pay uses extremely competitive market rates for crypto/USD.

??? question "What cryptocurrencies can I pay with?"

    You can pay with Bitcoin, Monero, and Litecoin natively, and in practically any cryptocurrency via native [Trocador](https://trocador.app) integration.
