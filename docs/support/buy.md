# Buy support

Cake Wallet supports a wide range of providers for purchasing cryptocurrencies using fiat currencies like USD, GBP, and Euros.

## Onramper

We use an [Onramper](https://onramper.com) widget to display most crypto providers. If you have an issue with the widget itself, please contact Cake Wallet support.

If you need support with your exchange provider, please find the support info for your provider on the [Onramper](https://knowledge.onramper.com/how-can-i-get-help) website.
