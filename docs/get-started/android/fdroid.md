In order to install Cake Wallet or Cupcake via F-Droid, you'll need to add our repository to either the F-Droid app or Obtainium itself.

You can find all necessary details for adding the repository at [fdroid.cakelabs.com](https://fdroid.cakelabs.com/).

If you would like to have a direct upgrade path *without* uninstalling Cake Wallet, you can do so by setting up [Obtainium](obtainium.md).

Otherwise, we recommend using [Accrescent](accrescent.md) for a more reliable update experience. However, this *will* require backing up all seeds and wallets (See [backup](/features/basic/create-backup/)) and uninstalling Cake Wallet, then re-installing from Accrescent.
