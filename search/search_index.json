This can lead to small (&lt;1%) differences in prices shown. For non-USD denominated products, the spread may be a little larger because we buy the cards in USD, and there is thus an implied spread that Cake must pay between USD and the other fiat asset. Always make sure to send the exact amount of cryptocurrency specified for the invoice.

Thus, brute force prevention is extremely difficult, and there is no way to guarantee that the wallet app will be able to fully protect against brute force attempts.</p> <p>A casual attacker who is interacting with the unmodified Cake Wallet user interface will be unable to make enough guesses to reliably bypass the TOTP code.
