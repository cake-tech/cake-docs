This can lead to small (&lt;1%) differences in prices shown. For non-USD denominated products, the spread may be a little larger because we buy the cards in USD, and there is thus an implied spread that Cake must pay between USD and the other fiat asset.

Thus, brute force prevention is extremely difficult, and there is no way to guarantee that the wallet app will be able to fully protect against brute force attempts.</p> <p>A casual attacker who is interacting with the unmodified Cake Wallet user interface will be unable to make enough guesses to reliably bypass the TOTP code.

MyMonero relies on sending a view key to a remote server, something that reduces your privacy but forgoes the need to sync your wallet at all. Cake Wallet takes a different approach, where you do all wallet sync on-device for maximum privacy. This sync process can take some time when restoring older wallets, but can be drastically improved by performing initial sync on a good network or enabling background sync on Android.</p>"},{"location":"tutorials/mymonero/#backing-up-your-monero-from-mymonero","title":"Backing up your Monero from MyMonero","text":"<ol> <li> <p>On the home page of MyMonero, select the wallet you want to migrate over to Cake</p> <p></p> </li> <li> <p>Expand the toggle/drop-down by Address</p> <p></p> </li> <li> <p>Confirm that you\u2019re in a safe place and are OK to display your private keys on-screen</p> </li> </ol> <p>Warning</p> <p>Do not share these seed words with anyone or store them via screenshots or in an insecure note app, as anyone with access to your seed words has the ability to steal all of your Monero!</p> <ol> <li> <p>Either tap the copy button, or write down your 25-word seed phrase (in the box labeled <code>Secret Mnemonic</code>) in a safe place where you can import it into Cake Wallet in the next section.
